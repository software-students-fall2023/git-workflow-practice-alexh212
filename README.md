<p> Is That a Model or AI by Katharine K. Zarrella
<i> The Wall Street Journal <i> <p>

I find this article interesting as it wrestles with the ethical implication of generative AI systems that may perpetuate systemic racism in the fashion industry. It's evident that AI tools can inadvertently hard marginalized groups due to these systems potentially being trained on baised historical decisions or data. 

However, some generative AI systems, such as lalaland.ai, carefully curate the training data to minimize biases. There is excitment and positivitiy surrounding the potemtial of AI, AR, and other rendering tools in the fashion industry. This enthuasim has even led some brands to introduce virtual 
"ambassadors", addressing the representation gap of minority groups in digital spaces.

I chose to comment on this article because I wrote about generative AI as well. The moral implications of AI need to be discussed heavily and it is nice to see that lots of news agencies are staying on top of that. 

As I stated in my paragraph new technology should be openly accepted as long as it has the proper precatuions.
